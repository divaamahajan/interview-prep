**How do you handle version control in the cloud?**

Hide Answer

I manage version control in the cloud with version control systems like Git and Mercurial. These technologies help me to trace file changes and revert to prior versions if necessary. In addition, I utilize a cloud storage service like Dropbox to save all versions of my work in the cloud.
